## Project rules
- All money changes go through SECURITY DEFINER Postgres functions (place_order, create_deposit, cancel_my_order) that write wallet_ledger; clients have SELECT-only grants on business tables. Why: balances must never be trusted from the client.
- Sign-in by email/phone/User ID/username is resolved in a server function (src/lib/sign-in.functions.ts) so emails are never exposed to anonymous clients.
- Signed-in pages live under src/routes/_authenticated/ (gate redirects to /sign-in?redirect=). Why: one place for auth guarding.
- Business data uses soft delete (deleted_at); seeds use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING. Why: redeploys must never lose data.
- Admin access is a password-only httpOnly cookie session (src/lib/admin.server.ts) separate from customer auth; every admin server function must call requireAdmin(). Why: admin passwords live only in server secrets/DB hash.
- Storage buckets are private (workspace blocks public); store object paths and render via signed URLs (useStorageUrl). Why: public buckets are not allowed.
